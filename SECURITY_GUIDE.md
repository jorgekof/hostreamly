## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Management

#### Token Types
- **Access Token**: Short-lived (15 minutes) for API requests
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (7 days) for obtaining new access tokens

#### Token Security Features
- Cryptographically signed with HS256 algorithm
- Automatic expiration and refresh mechanism
- Token blacklisting for logout functionality
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies (recommended)

#### Implementation
```javascript
// Token generation with security headers
const generateTokens = (user) => {
  const accessToken = jwt.sign(
    { id: user.id, role: user.role },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '15m' }
  );
  
  const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
    { id: user.id, type: 'refresh' },
    process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '7d' }
  );
  
  return { accessToken, refreshToken };
};
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles
- **User**: Basic access to platform features
- **Premium**: Enhanced features and higher limits
- **Admin**: Administrative access to system management
- **Super Admin**: Full system access and configuration

#### Plan-Based Authorization
- **Starter Plan**: 100GB storage, 500GB bandwidth
- **Professional Plan**: 500GB storage, 2TB bandwidth
- **Enterprise Plan**: 1TB storage, 5TB bandwidth, live streaming

#### Middleware Implementation
```javascript
// Role-based middleware
const requireRole = (roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const userRoles = Array.isArray(req.user.role) ? req.user.role : [req.user.role];
    const hasRequiredRole = roles.some(role => userRoles.includes(role));
    
    if (!hasRequiredRole) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        error: 'Access denied',
        message: 'Insufficient permissions'
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

### Password Security

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  max: 10, // 10 attempts per window
  message: {
    error: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later',
    retryAfter: 5 * 60
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});
```

### Input Validation

  body('title')
    .isLength({ min: 1, max: 255 })
    .trim()
